1. What is Cloud Computing?
	- For non-programmers, we use it every day. For eg: Youtube. 
		When you watch a Youtube video, you are acting as a client, but there are some server somewhere which is streaming
		the video. The server is storing that video.
	- For a programmer
		It's basically when you write code but run it on some rented remote machine and you may not worry about specific
		details about that hardware.


2. The Mainframe model
	- In the 1950s there used to be one BIG hardware. And users would share that hardware amongst themselves,
		based on time and/or resources.
	- Advantages of using this were obviously cost-effectiveness.
	- But then personal computers came into the picture and suddenly everyone had their own "personal" computer.


3. The On-premises model
	- Companies had data centers, where they would have multiple servers, which they would maintain and configure themselves.
	- They would "estimate" the maximum use case of their resources and thus buy the hardware accordingly because they could
		not upscale whenever required.
	- Then came VMs, which made things a little bit easy as One server can host multiple VMS and share resources. Thus, 
			virtually up and downscaling resources between VMs that host servers.

4. Some disadvantages of characteristics of on-prem model
	- We need CI/CD for big applications so Monolith was no option.
	- It was very difficult to predict scalability.
	- RDBMS was an issue because entire data was on database server.
	- In a modern distributed architecture, its not very convenient to "not" design for failure (CAP theorem).
	- When we got a big application running on a server, the server becomes a "Unique Snowflake" and we need to do the exact 
		same things if we want to replicate that runtime, which is very difficult.

5. Scalability is the ability to increase resources on-demand as needed. Elasticity when we can go up and down on resources.

6. CapEx = Capital Expenditure
	- Expenditure require in setting up and maintaining on-prem data center.
	- Usually cheaper for long-term

7. OpEx = Operational Expenditure
	- Expenditure required in renting cloud services.
	- Cheaper to start.

8. Public Cloud - available on the internet (AWS)

9. Private Cloud - Kind of like mimicking AWS on-premises.

10. Hybrid Cloud - Mixture of both. Usually happens when companies are migrating from on-prem to cloud.

11. Economies of Scale - Architect needs to keep in mind the cost that will required if and when application needs scaling.

12. Generic cloud service types:
	a) Computer (VM)
	b) Storage 
	c) Network
	d) Application (Elastic Bean Stalk)
	e) Metrics/Analytics

13. General deployment models
	a) IAAS	-> Cloud will only provide you machines and basic OS, and security, you will do the whole thing.
	b) PAAS	-> Cloud will provide you machines, elasticity, maintenance, etc. You will just write code and deploy.
	c) SAAS	-> Cloud will write the code and maintain the software as well. You will just use the Software as a service. 
				Eg: Gmail, Google drive, Google docs, etc.

14. Regions
	- Cloud providers have data centers in various regions around the world.
	- Choosing regions is based on :
		a) Latency (closest to users)
		b) Services available in that region
		c) Cost of using a service in that region.
		d) Data compliance (US medical records should not be in a data center outside US)

15. Availability zones
	- One region can have multiple avaiability zones.
	- Main reason is to be disaster ready.
	- In case one AZ gets distroyed, other should not be ideally affected and thus we have copy of our application which
		we can still run.
